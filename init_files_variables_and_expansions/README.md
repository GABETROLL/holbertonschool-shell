#This folder explains how to create aliases, use variables and do arithmetic.
#Arithmetic in bash is done '$((expression))', with the same operations as C.

##Scripts:
	0: Create an alias 'ls' that executes 'rm *' (evil)
	1: Use the '$USER' variable to say hello to the current user
	2: Add '/action' to $PATH, with a colon between '/action' and the rest of $PATH

	4: Print all global variables
